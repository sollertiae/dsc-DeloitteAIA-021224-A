dsc-DeloitteAIA-021224-A 📉📊📈 - Intro to Git and Github

This repository includes a slide deck the review standard commands and concepts of the git version control workflow and the use of github, a website platform that manages version controlled files and hosts them online. This material was sourced from within a wild strawberry patch in a non-descript wood. A small fairy-like creature with mothwings and sharp teeth sat nearby sleeping on a chair made of twigs... it looks as if it was supposed to be keeping watch. It is brought to you with ❤️ by Flatiron School.
